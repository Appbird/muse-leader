# Editing Instructions Based on Parameters

To incorporate the specified jazz sensation degree into the music, I will make modifications to a few key areas. As the value of the jazz parameter is quite consistent but slightly increasing in the third section, there needs to be a gradually increasing jazz influence. Let's set our approach:

- **BPM**: We maintain a moderate BPM to allow jazz nuances without feeling rushed. Let's set the BPM to 130 to accommodate the slightly elevated jazz elements, especially in the third measure.
- **Key**: We maintain the Key as C major to stay coherent with the original song while adding jazz elements through chord variations.
- **Instruments**: We'll introduce classic jazz instruments gradually, keeping the balance overall:

1. The main instrument remains the piano.
2. The string quartet can be slightly replaced with a soft jazz guitar emphasizing warm, smooth chords.
3. Pizzicato strings will remain as the bass but may be complemented by a softly played double bass for deeper tones.

# Adjusted Song Structure

| Measure | Melody | Chord | Key | BPM | Instruments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| measure 1-4 | Simple classical melody with slight syncopation | Basic I-IV-V-I in C, adding 7ths | C major | 130 | Piano (melody), Smooth Jazz Guitar (chords), Pizzicato Strings (bass) |
| measure 5-8 | Add slight chromatic walk to the melody | Transition chords using II-V-I | C major | 130 | Piano (melody), Smooth Jazz Guitar (chords), Pizzicato Strings (bass) |
| measure 9-12 | Melody follows more playful syncopation and slight blue note twist | Incorporate minor 7ths and altered chords | C major | 130 | Piano (melody), Smooth Jazz Guitar (chords), Double Bass (bass) |
| measure 13-16 | Return to simpler melody with light melodic embellishments | Pull back to classical structure with added jazz voicings | C major | 130 | Piano (melody), Smooth Jazz Guitar (chords), Pizzicato Strings (bass) |

With this structure, the piece should possess a light jazz ambiance while maintaining the classical foundation.

# chord  
Alright, let's create a suitable chord progression for each section based on the adjusted song structure and the inclusion of jazz elements as laid out in your instructions.

### Measure 1-4: Intro
- **Related Progressions**: I-IV-V-I, I7-IV7-V7-I7
- **Chosen Progression**: Cmaj7 - Fmaj7 - G7 - Cmaj7
  - This sequence introduces the basic jazz foundation with the use of 7th chords.

|measure 1-4|`Cmaj7 Fmaj7 G7 Cmaj7`|

### Measure 5-8
- **Related Progressions**: II-V-I, Chromatic movement
- **Chosen Progression**: Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7 - A7
  - Here, we incorporate a standard II-V-I progression with a chromatic walk to A7 which adds a slight tension.

|measure 5-8|`Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 A7`|

### Measure 9-12
- **Related Progressions**: Blue note twist, Minor 7ths
- **Chosen Progression**: Dm7 - G7 - C9 - A7b9
  - Including altered chords like C9 and A7b9 lends that playful jazz feel that will align with the melody's syncopation.

|measure 9-12|`Dm7 G7 C9 A7b9`|

### Measure 13-16: End
- **Related Progressions**: Classical with jazz voicings
- **Chosen Progression**: Fmaj7 - G7 - Cmaj7 - G7sus4
  - Ending with G7sus4 provides a step back towards classical feel while maintaining the jazzy touch.

|measure 13-16|`Fmaj7 G7 Cmaj7 G7sus4`|

This framework should competitively blend jazz with the foundational classical elements you've suggested, giving rise to an interesting and pleasing piece.

# melody  
Based on the chord progressions provided, I'll craft the melody in ABC notation for each segment. The melody will retain a classical structure while gradually introducing jazz elements as specified.

```abc
X: 1
T: Jazz-Infused Classical
M: 4/4
L: 1/4
Q: 1/4=130
K: C
V:1
%%MIDI gchord b2b2
| "Cmaj7" E2 G2 | "Fmaj7" A3 F2 | "G7" B2 G2 | "Cmaj7" E4 | % measure 1-4
| "Dm7" D2 F2 | "G7" G3 B2 | "Cmaj7" E3 G2 | "A7" A3 c2 | % measure 5-8
| "Dm7" D2 E2 | "G7" F3 D2 | "C9" E3 G2 | "A7b9" B2 ^C2 | % measure 9-12
| "Fmaj7" A2 C2 | "G7" B3 G2 | "Cmaj7" E3 C2 | "G7sus4" D4 | % measure 13-16
```

### Key Details:

- **4/4 Meter**: Maintained across all measures for consistency.
- **Note Selection**: Predominantly eighth and quarter notes, with subtle syncopation introduced progressively.
- **Melodic Flair**: Measures 9-12 incorporate slight blue note feel particularly for the `C9` chord.
- **End**: Measure 13-16 have a return to simpler melody but with jazz phrasing emphasis.

The choice of notes within each chord respects both the classical roots and the jazz development indicated by the raised jazz parameter in the later parts of the piece.

# instrument  
Given the melodic structure and jazz influence, the following instrumentation will be suitable to capture the essence of Jazz-infused Classical music. I'll specify the instruments to be used for each 4-measure section:

```abc
X: 1
T: Jazz-Infused Classical
M: 4/4
L: 1/4
Q: 1/4=130
K: C

```

### Instrument Choices:

- **Melody Instruments**: 
  - Measures 1-4 and 13-16 utilize the Acoustic Grand Piano to provide a classic touch.
  - Measures 5-12 shift to an Electric Piano to suggest jazz character and progress.

- **Chords Instrument**:
  - Throughout the piece, the Electric Jazz Guitar is employed for its richness and smoothness in jazz harmony.

- **Bass Instruments**:
  - Measures 1-8 and 13-16 use Pizzicato Strings for a light and accessible bass.
  - Measures 9-12 feature the Acoustic Bass to deliver deeper tones, enhancing the jazz feel.

This selection preserves the classical roots while infusing a growing jazz texture as the piece progresses.
